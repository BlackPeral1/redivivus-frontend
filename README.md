# Redivivus Online Garbage Recycling Management System

In latin redivivus means reborn. That's what we do via this web app. We give life to garbage which are just thrown away without taking any use from. We allow people to sell their household garbage to recyclers. Webapp was developed using MERN. This is the front end repo. Boostrap was used for front end styling.
